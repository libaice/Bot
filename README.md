## 📚 About

In the fascinating world of cryptocurrency, understanding what an MEV Bot is, can be crucial. A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot is a sophisticated arbitrage instrument that scouts the Mempool for pending transactions on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. It cunningly inserts our transaction with a slightly higher gas fee (1 Gwei more than the transaction attempting to enter), thus sandwiching the pending transaction and ensuring ours is processed first, reaping profits from the slippage differences.

## 🚀 How it Works


</div>

#### Our Bot performs the following steps faster than other bots:

1. Sends the transaction.
2. Sniffs the Uniswap v2 Mempool.
3. Competes to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victim's transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity.
4. Sends back the ETH to the contract, ready for withdrawal.
